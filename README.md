# ATM
This has 2 projects in the file The ATM project which is 
-Programmed in Java, it allows the user to access both checking and savings accounts, withdraw money, put in money, and transfer money between the 2 accounts.
-It also makes the user create an account to access the service, without it the user cannot use the atm machine without an account number and a pin. The program also does not allow for users to have negative balances.
This also inculdes the data anyaltics project 
-A group project developed in Python using, Numpy library, Panda library, and Matplotlib library
-Based on 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data My group members and myself answered the following questions 
    -Firstly, the relationship between the number of passengers and the distance traveled/time it took to complete the trip.
    -Secondly the correlation between the number of trips and the time of the trip (the dates on which consumers use the taxi system and if there is a certain number of days which they use it more). 
    -Finally, the correlation between trip distance and the time it took to complete the trip.
I helped out provide the exploratory data analysis as well as analyzing the data to help create graphs that will help answer the aforementioned questions above
